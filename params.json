Let's hope they will manage to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES AND OTHER LEARNING RESOURCES\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Official demo\r\n\r\n[impress.js demo](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js) by [@bartaz](http://twitter.com/bartaz)\r\n\r\n### Examples and demos\r\n\r\nMore examples and demos can be found on [Examples and demos wiki page](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/wiki/Examples-and-demos).\r\n\r\nFeel free to add your own example presentations (or websites) there.\r\n\r\n### Other tutorials and learning resources\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn even more there is a [list of tutorials and other learning resources](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/wiki/impress.js-tutorials-and-other-learning-resources)\r\non the wiki, too.\r\n\r\nThese is also a book available about [Building impressive presentations with impress.js](http://www.packtpub.com/building-impressive-presentations-with-impressjs/book) by Rakhitha Nimesh Ratnayake.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANT TO CONTRIBUTE?\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIf you've found a bug or have a great idea for new feature let me know by [adding your suggestion]\r\n(http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/issues/new) to [issues list](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/issues).\r\n\r\nIf you have fixed a bug or implemented a feature that you'd like to share, send your pull request against [dev branch]\r\n(http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/dev). But remember that I only accept code that fits my vision of impress.js\r\nand my coding standards - so make sure you are open for discussion :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT THE NAME\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nimpress.js name in [courtesy of @skuzniak](http://twitter.com/skuzniak/status/143627215165333504).\r\n\r\nIt's an (un)fortunate coincidence that a Open/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n### 0.5.3 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.5.3), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.5.3), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.5.3))\r\n\r\n#### BUGFIX RELEASE\r\n\r\nVersion 0.5 introduced events including `impress:stepenter`, but this event was not triggered properly in some\r\nspecific transition types (for example when only scale was changing between steps). It was caused by the fact that\r\nin such cases expected `transitionend` event was not triggered.\r\n\r\nThis version fixes this issue. Unfortunately modern `transitionend` event is no longer used to detect when the\r\ntransition has finished, but old school (and more reliable) `setTimeout` is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.5.2 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.5.2), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.5.2), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.5.2))\r\n\r\n#### DOCUMENTATION RELEASE\r\n\r\nMore descriptive comments added to demo CSS and impress.js source file, so now not only `index.html` is worth reading ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.5.1 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.5.1), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.5.1), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.5.1))\r\n\r\n#### BUGFIX RELEASE\r\n\r\nChanges in version 0.5 introduced a bug (#126) that was preventing clicks on links (or any clickable elements) on\r\ncurrently active step. This release fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.5 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.5), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.5), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.5))\r\n\r\n#### CHANGELOG\r\n\r\n* API changed, so that `impress()` function no longer automatically initialize presentation; new method called `init`\r\n  was added to API and it should be used to start the presentation\r\n* event `impress:init` is triggered on root presentation element (`#impress` by default) when presentation is initialized\r\n* new CSS classes were added: `impress-disabled` is added to body element by the impress.js script and it's changed to \r\n  `impress-enabled` when `init()` function is called\r\n* events added when step is entered and left - custom `impress:stepenter` and `impress:stepleave` events are triggered\r\n  on step elements and can be handled like any other DOM events (with `addEventListener`)\r\n* additional `past`, `present` and `future` classes are added to step elements\r\n    - `future` class appears on steps that were not yet visited\r\n    - `present` class appears on currently visible step - it's different from `active` class as `present` class\r\n       is added when transition finishes (step is entered)\r\n    - `past` class is added to already visited steps (when the step is left)\r\n* and good news, `goto()` API method is back! it seems that `goto` **was** a future reserved word but isn't anymore,\r\n  so we can use this short and pretty name instead of camelCassy `stepTo` - and yes, that means API changed again...\r\n* additionally `goto()` method now supports new types of parameters:\r\n    - you can give it a number of step you want to go to: `impress().goto(7)`\r\n    - or its id: `impress().goto(\"the-best-slide-ever\")`\r\n    - of course DOM element is still acceptable: `impress().goto( document.getElementById(\"overview\") )`\r\n* and if it's not enough, `goto()` also accepts second parameter to define the transition duration in ms, for example\r\n  `impress().goto(\"make-it-quick\", 300)` or `impress().goto(\"now\", 0)`\r\n\r\n#### UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS\r\n\r\nIn current version calling `impress()` doesn't automatically initialize the presentation. You need to call `init()`\r\nfunction from the API. So in a place were you called `impress()` to initialize impress.js simply change this call\r\nto `impress().init()`.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.4 changed `goto` API method into `stepTo`. It turned out that `goto` is not a reserved word anymore, so it\r\ncan be used in JavaScript. That's why version 0.5 brings it back and removes `stepTo`.\r\n\r\nSo if you have been using version 0.4 and have any reference to `stepTo` API method make sure to change it to `goto`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.4.1 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.4.1), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.4.1), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.4.1))\r\n\r\n#### BUGFIX RELEASE\r\n\r\nChanges is version 0.4 introduced a bug causing JavaScript errors being thrown all over the place in fallback mode.\r\nThis release fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a flag `impress.supported` that can be used in JavaScript to check if impress.js is supported in the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.4 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.4), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.4), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.4))\r\n\r\n#### CHANGELOG\r\n\r\n* configuration options on `#impress` element: `data-perspective` (in px, defaults so 1000),\r\n  `data-transition-duration` (in ms, defaults to 1000)\r\n* automatic scaling to fit window size, with configuration options:  `data-width` (in px, defaults to 1024),\r\n  `data-height` (in px, defaults to 768), `max-scale` (defaults to 1), `min-scale` (defaults to 0)\r\n* `goto` API function was renamed to `stepTo` because `goto` is a future reserved work in JavaScript,\r\n  so **please make sure to update your code**\r\n* fallback `impress-not-supported` class is now set on `body` element instead of `#impress` element and it's\r\n  replaced with `impress-supported` when browser supports all required features\r\n* classes `step-ID` used to indicate progress of the presentation are now renamed to `impress-on-ID` and are\r\n  set on `body` element, so **please make sure to update your code**\r\n* basic validation of configuration options\r\n* couple of typos and bugs fixed\r\n* favicon added ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS\r\n\r\nIf in your custom JavaScript code you were using `goto()` function from impress.js API make sure to change it\r\nto `stepTo()`.\r\n\r\nIf in your CSS you were using classes based on currently active step with `step-` prefix, such as `step-bored`\r\n(where `bored` is the id of the step element) make sure to change it to `impress-on-` prefix\r\n(for example `impress-on-bored`). Also in previous versions these classes were assigned to `#impress` element\r\nand now they are added to `body` element, so if your CSS code depends on this, it also should be updated.\r\n\r\nSame happened to `impress-not-supported` class name - it was moved from `#impress` element to `body`, so update\r\nyour CSS if it's needed.\r\n\r\n#### NOTE ON BLACKBERRY PLAYBOOK\r\n\r\nChanges and fixes added in this version have broken the experience on Blackberry Playbook with OS in version 1.0.\r\nIt happened due to a bug in the Playbook browser in this version. Fortunately in version 2.0 of Playbook OS this\r\nbug was fixed and impress.js works fine.\r\n\r\nSo currently impress.js work only on Blackberry Playbook with latest OS. Fortunately, [it seems that most of the\r\nusers](http://twitter.com/n_adam_stanley/status/178188611827679233) [are quite quick with updating their devices]\r\n(http://twitter.com/brcewane/status/178230406196379648)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.3 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.3), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.3), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.3))\r\n\r\n#### CHANGELOG\r\n\r\n* minor CSS 3D fixes\r\n* basic API to control the presentation flow from JavaScript\r\n* touch event support\r\n* basic support for iPad (iOS 5 and iOS 4 with polyfills) and Blackberry Playbook\r\n\r\n#### UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS\r\n\r\nBecause API was introduced the way impress.js script is initialized was changed a bit. You not only has to include\r\n`impress.js` script file, but also call `impress()` function.\r\n\r\nSee the source of `index.html` for example and more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.2 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.2), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.2), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.2))\r\n\r\n* tutorial/documentation added to `index.html` source file\r\n* being even more strict with strict mode\r\n* code clean-up\r\n* couple of small bug-fixes\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.1 ([browse](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/0.1), [zip](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/zipball/0.1), [tar](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tarball/0.1))\r\n\r\nFirst release.\r\n\r\nContains basic functionality for step placement and transitions between them\r\nwith simple fallback for non-supporting browsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWSER SUPPORT\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n### TL;DR;\r\n\r\nCurrently impress.js works fine in latest Chrome/Chromium browser, Safari 5.1 and Firefox 10.\r\nWith addition of some HTML5 polyfills (see below for details) it should work in Internet Explorer 10\r\n(currently available as Developers Preview).\r\nIt doesn't work in Opera, as it doesn't support CSS 3D transforms.\r\n\r\nAs a presentation tool it was not developed with mobile browsers in mind, but some tablets are good\r\nenough to run it, so it should work quite well on iPad (iOS 5, or iOS 4 with HTML5 polyfills) and \r\nBlackberry Playbook.\r\n\r\n### Still interested? Read more...\r\n\r\nAdditionally for the animations to run smoothly it's required to have hardware\r\nacceleration support in your browser. This depends on the browser, your operating\r\nsystem and even kind of graphic hardware you have in your machine.\r\n\r\nFor browsers not supporting CSS3 3D transforms impress.js adds `impress-not-supported`\r\nclass on `#impress` element, so fallback styles can be applied to make all the content accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Even more explanation and technical stuff\r\n\r\nLet's put this straight -- wide browser support was (and is) not on top of my priority list for\r\nimpress.js. It's built on top of fresh technologies that just start to appear in the browsers\r\nand I'd like to rather look forward and develop for the future than being slowed down by the past.\r\n\r\nBut it's not \"hard-coded\" for any particular browser or engine. If any browser in future will\r\nsupport features required to run impress.js, it will just begin to work there without changes in\r\nthe code.\r\n\r\nFrom technical point of view all the positioning of presentation elements in 3D requires CSS 3D\r\ntransforms support. Transitions between presentation steps are based on CSS transitions.\r\nSo these two features are required by impress.js to display presentation correctly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the support for CSS 3D transforms and transitions is not enough for animations to\r\nrun smoothly. If the browser doesn't support hardware acceleration or the graphic card is not \r\ngood enough the transitions will be laggy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the code of impress.js relies on APIs proposed in HTML5 specification, including\r\n`classList` and `dataset` APIs. If they are not available in the browser, impress.js will not work.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as these are JavaScript APIs there are polyfill libraries that patch older browsers\r\nwith these APIs.\r\n\r\nFor example IE10 is said to support CSS 3D transforms and transitions, but it doesn't have `classList`\r\nnor `dataset` APIs implemented at the moment. So including polyfill libraries *should* help IE10\r\nwith running impress.js.\r\n\r\n\r\n### And few more details about mobile support\r\n\r\nMobile browsers are currently not supported. Even Android browsers that support CSS 3D transforms are\r\nforced into fallback view at this point.\r\n\r\nFortunately some tablets seem to have good enough hardware support and browsers to handle it.\r\nCurrently impress.js presentations should work on iPad and Blackberry Playbook.\r\n\r\nIn theory iPhone should also be able to run it (as it runs the same software as iPad), but I haven't\r\nfound a good way to handle its small screen.\r\n\r\nAlso note that iOS supports `classList` and `dataset` APIs starting with version 5, so iOS 4.X and older\r\nrequires polyfills to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011-2012 Bartek Szopka\r\n\r\nReleased under the MIT and GPL (version 2 or later) Licenses.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
